## Description
This addon adds new locking door system.
- Doors can be unlocked to allow enemies and prisoners to pass by (only races that have inteligence "humanlike" or above).
**Note**: In order to unlock/lock door, colonist must "flick" the door. Unflicked door will work as unchanged for enemies and prisoners.
- Doors can exclude visitors (wanna lock some traders?).
- Pet doors for small animals can now be added to doors.
- Doors can be assigned to colonists (you can simply restrict rooms to specific colonists without allowed area manager).
- New Flicking job: Locking/unlocking doors, it has higher priority than normal flicking job. ("Flicking" doors is needed).

## How to use
Select door and left click "Lock" command if you want to unlock/lock door.
Right click for more options.
Alternatively you can use "Lock" inspector tab.

## Performance
This mod has almost zero impact on performance. It's quick and light.

## Why do I need this?
I've created this mod to allow prisoners walk through doors while keeping temperature indoors with Prison Labor mod.
You can use this mod to create heat/cold killboxes, lock traders inside, keeping base safe from animals but avoiding destroying doors by pirates.
Also you can lock bedrooms for specific colonists. When that colonist will be in second camp-like base, nobody will sleep in his bed.
You can lock areas from dirty vistors, or lock them when horde of manhunter animals is waiting outside.

## Compatibility
* You can enable this mod to old saves.
* You can disable this mod from saves, but you need to clear all locking/unlocking job first (all semi-transparent locks shouldn't be visible).
* There can be compatibility issues with mods that add custom doors with custom security mechanics.
